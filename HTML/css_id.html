        <p> The four seasons—spring, summer, fall, 
            and winter—follow one another regularly. Each has its own light,
            temperature, and weather patterns that repeat yearly.
            In the Northern Hemisphere, winter generally 
            begins on December 21 or 22. This is the winter solstice,
            the day of the year with the shortest period of daylight.</p>
